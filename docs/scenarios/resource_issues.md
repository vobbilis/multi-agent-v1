# Resource Issues Analysis

## Introduction

Resource-related issues are among the most common causes of application failures and performance degradation in Kubernetes environments. These problems can manifest in various ways, from application crashes to subtle performance degradation, and often require analyzing multiple data sources to identify the root cause.

This document outlines common resource-related issues, how they manifest, and how the Multi-Agent Root Cause Analysis System detects and diagnoses them.

## Common Resource Issues

### Memory Exhaustion

**Description:**  
Applications or nodes running out of available memory, resulting in performance degradation, OOMKilled pods, or node failures.

**Symptoms:**
- Pods terminated with OOMKilled status
- High memory utilization on nodes
- Application performance degradation
- Swapping on nodes (if enabled)
- Memory fragmentation issues

**Detection Approach:**
1. **Logs Agent:** Identifies OOMKilled messages in pod and node logs
2. **Events Agent:** Detects pod termination events with OOMKilled reason
3. **Resource Agent:** Analyzes memory usage trends leading up to the incident
4. **Analysis Engine:** Correlates memory pressure with application behavior and determines if the issue is:
   - Application memory leak
   - Insufficient memory limit configuration
   - Node-level memory pressure
   - Memory fragmentation

**Simulation Scenario:**  
`simulate/resource-issues/memory-exhaustion.yaml` creates a deployment that progressively consumes memory until it's terminated by the OOM killer.

### CPU Throttling

**Description:**  
Applications experiencing performance degradation due to CPU limits being reached, resulting in throttling.

**Symptoms:**
- Increased latency in application responses
- High CPU throttling metrics
- CPU usage consistently at or near limits
- Application timeouts
- Slow processing events

**Detection Approach:**
1. **Resource Agent:** Identifies high CPU throttling metrics
2. **Logs Agent:** Detects increased latency patterns in application logs
3. **Events Agent:** Correlates with any scaling or scheduling events
4. **Analysis Engine:** Determines if the issue is:
   - Insufficient CPU limits
   - CPU-intensive operations causing spikes
   - Noisy neighbor problems
   - Inefficient application code

**Simulation Scenario:**  
`simulate/resource-issues/cpu-throttling.yaml` deploys an application with low CPU limits that experiences throttling under load.

### Resource Quota Exhaustion

**Description:**  
Namespace resource quotas being reached, preventing the creation or scaling of resources.

**Symptoms:**
- Failed pod scheduling
- Failed deployment scaling
- Resource quota exceeded events
- Pending pods
- Failed creation of Kubernetes resources

**Detection Approach:**
1. **Events Agent:** Identifies quota exceeded events
2. **Resource Agent:** Analyzes resource usage against quota limits
3. **Configuration Agent:** Examines namespace quota configurations
4. **Analysis Engine:** Determines the specific resources hitting limits and suggests:
   - Quota adjustments
   - Resource optimization opportunities
   - Workload redistribution across namespaces

**Simulation Scenario:**  
`simulate/resource-issues/quota-exhaustion.yaml` creates a namespace with restrictive quotas and deployments that attempt to exceed them.

### Node Pressure

**Description:**  
Nodes experiencing resource pressure (CPU, memory, disk IO, etc.) that affects multiple workloads.

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple pods showing performance issues on the same node
- High node resource utilization
- Disk pressure or IO issues
- Kubelet pressure conditions reported
- Eviction events

**Detection Approach:**
1. **Resource Agent:** Detects high node-level resource utilization
2. **Events Agent:** Identifies node pressure condition events
3. **Logs Agent:** Analyzes kubelet logs for pressure-related messages
4. **Analysis Engine:** Correlates node conditions with pod performance and determines:
   - Over-committed nodes
   - Noisy neighbor issues
   - Node capacity issues
   - Kubelet configuration problems

**Simulation Scenario:**  
`simulate/resource-issues/node-pressure.yaml` simulates a node under high resource pressure affecting multiple pods.

### Resource Request-Limit Imbalance

**Description:**  
Pods configured with inappropriate request-to-limit ratios causing inefficient resource utilization or performance issues.

**Symptoms:**
- Pods being throttled despite low overall node utilization
- Poor bin-packing of pods on nodes
- Inefficient cluster utilization
- QoS classification issues

**Detection Approach:**
1. **Configuration Agent:** Analyzes pod resource configurations
2. **Resource Agent:** Correlates actual usage with requests and limits
3. **Analysis Engine:** Identifies pods with suboptimal resource configurations and recommends:
   - Request-limit ratio adjustments
   - Right-sizing based on actual usage
   - QoS class changes

**Simulation Scenario:**  
`simulate/resource-issues/request-limit-imbalance.yaml` demonstrates pods with poorly configured resource settings.

### Pod Scheduling Failures

**Description:**  
Pods failing to schedule due to resource constraints, node selectors, affinity rules, or taints.

**Symptoms:**
- Pods stuck in Pending state
- FailedScheduling events
- Insufficient resource messages
- Node affinity constraints not satisfied

**Detection Approach:**
1. **Events Agent:** Detects FailedScheduling events and their reasons
2. **Configuration Agent:** Analyzes pod specifications for constraints
3. **Resource Agent:** Examines available resources across nodes
4. **Analysis Engine:** Identifies the specific scheduling constraints preventing pod placement:
   - Resource availability issues
   - Node selector/affinity constraints
   - Taint/toleration mismatches
   - PodDisruptionBudget issues

**Simulation Scenario:**  
`simulate/resource-issues/scheduling-failure.yaml` creates pods with constraints that cannot be satisfied.

## Analysis Process

The Resource Agent follows a systematic approach to diagnosing resource-related issues:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather resource metrics (CPU, memory, storage) for affected pods and nodes
   - Collect resource configuration data (requests, limits, quotas)
   - Retrieve historical resource utilization patterns

2. **Pattern Identification:**
   - Detect sudden changes in resource utilization
   - Identify resource exhaustion patterns
   - Recognize throttling signatures
   - Spot configuration anomalies

3. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - Compare current resource usage with historical baselines
   - Correlate resource events with application behavior
   - Analyze resource efficiency (utilization vs. requests/limits)
   - Examine node-level resource conditions

4. **Finding Generation:**
   - Produce structured resource findings with severity ratings
   - Include relevant metrics and thresholds
   - Provide temporal context (when did resource pressure begin)
   - Link to related configuration issues

5. **Recommendation Development:**
   - Suggest resource configuration adjustments
   - Recommend scaling strategies
   - Propose workload redistribution options
   - Identify potential resource optimizations

## Integration with Other Agents

Resource issues rarely exist in isolation. The system integrates findings from multiple agents:

1. **Logs Agent:** Correlates resource pressure with application errors or warnings
2. **Events Agent:** Connects resource issues with Kubernetes events (scheduling, scaling)
3. **Network Agent:** Identifies if resource constraints affect network performance
4. **Storage Agent:** Determines if disk pressure is contributing to resource issues
5. **Configuration Agent:** Reviews resource-related configuration best practices

## Testing and Verification

To verify the system's ability to detect and diagnose resource issues:

1. **Simulation Scenarios:**
   - Each resource issue type has a corresponding YAML file in `simulate/resource-issues/`
   - These scenarios create controlled resource problems for testing

2. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - For each scenario, the system should identify the specific resource issue
   - The Analysis Engine should provide accurate root cause determination
   - Recommendations should address the underlying resource problem

3. **Validation Metrics:**
   - Time to detect resource anomalies
   - Accuracy of resource constraint identification
   - Precision of root cause determination
   - Relevance of resource optimization recommendations

## Conclusion

Resource-related issues require a multi-faceted analysis approach that considers configuration, utilization, and application behavior. By leveraging specialized agents working in concert, the Multi-Agent Root Cause Analysis System can effectively diagnose complex resource problems and provide actionable recommendations for resolution.
