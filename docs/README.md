- [Extension Points](development/extension_points.md): Customization guidelines

### Diagrams
The [diagrams](diagrams/) directory contains architectural and workflow diagrams:
- [System Architecture](diagrams/system_architecture.txt): Overall system design

## Using This Documentation

### For Operators
Start with the [Deployment Guide](deployment/deployment_guide.md) for installation instructions, then refer to [Configuration](deployment/configuration.md) and [Operations](operations/) documentation for day-to-day management.

### For Developers
Begin with the [System Overview](architecture/system_overview.md) and [Development Guide](development/dev_guide.md) to understand the architecture and development process.

### For Users
The [API Reference](api/api_reference.md) provides comprehensive details on interacting with the system programmatically, while [Scenarios](scenarios/) documentation explains common use cases.

## Documentation Conventions

- Markdown is used for all documentation files
- Code examples are provided in appropriate syntax highlighting

- Diagrams are provided as text (ASCII art) for version control compatibility
- Each document follows a consistent structure:
  - Introduction/Purpose
  - Detailed Sections
  - Examples (where applicable)
  - References to Related Documentation

## Contributing to Documentation
