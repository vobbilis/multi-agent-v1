This ASCII diagram represents the data flow within the Multi-Agent Root Cause Analysis System, showing how information moves through the system from incident detection to resolution:

1. The process begins with incident detection from monitoring systems or user reports
2. The Orchestrator creates an investigation context and activates relevant Specialist Agents
3. Agents collect and preprocess data, identifying initial patterns
4. Agent-specific analysis generates findings which are aggregated by the Orchestrator
5. The Analysis Engine performs temporal analysis and identifies causal relationships
6. Hypotheses are tested and validated with confidence scoring
7. Root causes are determined and recommendations generated
8. Results are stored in the Knowledge Base for future reference and learning
9. The API Gateway delivers results to users and external systems
10. The system learns and improves from resolution feedback

This flow represents a complete cycle of root cause analysis, from detection to resolution and learning.
