This ASCII diagram represents the system architecture of the Multi-Agent Root Cause Analysis System, showing the relationships between the core components:

1. External Systems connect to the API Gateway
2. API Gateway interfaces with the Orchestrator and Knowledge Base
3. Orchestrator coordinates the Specialist Agents and interfaces with the Analysis Engine
4. Specialist Agents gather data from the Kubernetes Environment
5. Analysis Engine processes findings and updates the Knowledge Base
6. All components interact in a coordinated workflow for root cause analysis
