# Kubernetes Root Cause Analysis Engine
## Multi-Agent Architecture with LangGraph and LangSmith

This document describes the architecture and design of a multi-agent system for Kubernetes root cause analysis using LangGraph for orchestration and LangSmith for monitoring and tracing.

## Overview

The system consists of a master coordinator agent and multiple specialist agents, each responsible for analyzing different aspects of Kubernetes clusters. The master agent orchestrates the investigation process, delegates tasks to specialist agents, collects and analyzes their findings, and provides a comprehensive root cause analysis report with actionable next steps.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Master Coordinator Agent

The master coordinator agent serves as the central orchestrator of the root cause analysis process. It:

- Receives initial problem descriptions and symptoms
- Formulates an investigation plan using decision trees
- Dispatches tasks to specialist agents based on the current state
- Aggregates and synthesizes findings from specialist agents
- Conducts reasoning based on collected evidence
- Provides final root cause analysis and recommendations
- Generates visualizations of the investigation flow

### 2. Specialist Agents

Each specialist agent focuses on a specific aspect of Kubernetes:

#### a. Cluster Infrastructure Agent
Analyzes node health, resource utilization, and hardware/cloud provider issues.

#### b. Networking Agent
Investigates network policies, DNS issues, service connectivity, and ingress/egress problems.

#### c. Workload Agent
Examines pod/deployment failures, scheduling issues, resource constraints, and lifecycle problems.

#### d. Configuration Agent
Analyzes misconfigurations in manifests, CRDs, RBAC issues, and policy violations.

#### e. Resource Management Agent
Investigates resource quotas, limits, requests, and capacity planning issues.

#### f. State Agent
Examines etcd health, API server status, and control plane component issues.

#### g. Logs & Events Agent
Analyzes logs, events, and audit trails for anomalies and error patterns.

#### h. Security Agent
Investigates security incidents, policy violations, and authentication/authorization issues.

### 3. LangGraph Orchestration Engine

LangGraph provides the framework for:

- Building the directed graph of agent interactions
- Managing state transitions between investigation phases
- Implementing conditional execution paths
- Handling branching decision logic
- Supporting parallel agent execution when appropriate
- Managing context and information flow between agents

### 4. LangSmith Integration

LangSmith is used for:

- Monitoring agent performance and interactions
- Tracing the execution path of investigations
- Evaluating the quality of agent responses
- Providing debugging capabilities
- Storing investigation patterns for future reference
- Improving agent performance through feedback loops

## Decision Flow Architecture

The system implements a dynamic decision tree for investigation:

1. **Initial Assessment Phase**
   - Master agent collects initial symptoms
   - Formulates initial hypotheses
   - Dispatches preliminary investigations to multiple specialist agents

2. **Evidence Collection Phase**
   - Specialist agents gather relevant information
   - Each agent returns structured findings and confidence scores
   - Master agent aggregates evidence and updates investigation state

3. **Hypothesis Testing Phase**
   - Based on initial findings, master agent forms specific hypotheses
   - Dispatches targeted investigations to test each hypothesis
   - Implements conditional branching based on findings

4. **Root Cause Determination Phase**
   - Master agent performs causal analysis on collected evidence
   - Identifies most probable root causes
   - Determines severity and impact

5. **Recommendation Generation Phase**
   - Formulates specific remediation steps
   - Prioritizes actions based on impact and effort
   - Generates comprehensive report

## Implementation Details

### Agent Communication Protocol

Agents communicate using structured JSON messages containing:
- Task description and context
- Required investigation steps
- Relevant resources to examine
- Previous findings and context
- Confidence thresholds for findings

### Evidence Collection Framework

Evidence is structured as:
- Resource identifiers
- Observation timestamps
- Raw data collected
- Analysis results
- Confidence scores
- Related resources
- Potential implications

### Decision Tree Implementation

The master agent uses:
- Conditional execution based on evidence evaluation
- State-based routing of investigation flows
- Dynamic adjustment of investigation paths
- Parallel investigation branches when appropriate
- Re-convergence of findings from multiple branches

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed as:
- Kubernetes operator with appropriate RBAC
- Horizontally scalable specialist agent pools
- Persistent storage for investigation history
- Integration with existing monitoring systems
- API endpoints for triggering investigations
- Dashboard for visualization and human interaction

## Usage Workflow

1. Incident or anomaly detected in Kubernetes cluster
2. RCA Engine initiated with initial symptoms
3. Master agent formulates initial investigation plan
4. Specialist agents execute investigations in parallel
5. Master agent processes findings and adjusts investigation
6. Additional evidence gathered based on emerging patterns
7. Final analysis generated with evidence chain
8. Recommendations provided for remediation
9. Investigation trace stored for future reference

## Visualization Capabilities

The system provides:
- Interactive investigation flow diagrams
- Evidence relationship graphs
- Confidence heatmaps for different hypotheses
- Timeline views of the investigation process
- Resource relationship visualizations

## Human-in-the-Loop Integration

The architecture supports:
- Intervention points for human analysts
- Ability to inject expert knowledge
- Manual overrides for investigation direction
- Feedback mechanisms for improving agent performance
- Collaboration tools for team-based troubleshooting
