# Events Agent

## Overview

The Events Agent is a specialized component that monitors, collects, and analyzes Kubernetes events to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential issues in the cluster. It processes event streams to extract meaningful insights about system state changes, resource transitions, and error conditions that contribute to root cause analysis.

## Responsibilities

- Collecting and monitoring Kubernetes events across the cluster
- Categorizing events by type, source, and severity
- Detecting unusual event patterns or frequencies
- Correlating events with system state changes
- Identifying causal relationships between events
- Generating structured findings based on event analysis
- Providing confidence scores for event-based observations

## Implementation Details

The Events Agent is implemented as a Python module with the following key components:

1. **Event Collector**: Interfaces with the Kubernetes API to stream events and retrieve historical event data. It supports:
   - Real-time event streaming
   - Historical event retrieval with filtering
   - Event batching and pagination
   - Resource-specific event collection

2. **Event Classifier**: Categorizes events based on:
   - Event type (Normal, Warning)
   - Event reason (Created, Failed, Killing, etc.)
   - Source component (Pod, Node, ReplicaSet, etc.)
   - Involved objects (specific resources affected)
   - Namespace and cluster scope

3. **Sequence Analyzer**: Examines temporal relationships between events:
   - Identifies event chains and sequences
   - Detects time-based patterns and correlations
   - Recognizes common event flow patterns
   - Maps event progression for specific scenarios

4. **Pattern Detector**: Identifies significant patterns in events:
   - Unusual frequency of specific event types
   - Known problematic event sequences
   - Missing expected events
   - Divergence from normal event patterns
   - Events correlated with system issues

5. **Finding Generator**: Creates structured findings based on event analysis:
   - Identified patterns and anomalies
   - Affected resources and components
   - Temporal information and sequence data
   - References to specific event instances
   - Potential implications and severity

6. **Confidence Calculator**: Assigns confidence scores to findings based on:
   - Pattern clarity and specificity
   - Consistency with known issues
   - Supporting evidence in event data
   - Temporal proximity to reported problems
   - Cross-validation with other event patterns

## Interfaces

### Input

The Events Agent accepts the following inputs:

1. **Event Sources**: Specification of event sources to monitor
2. **Time Range**: Period of events to analyze
3. **Resource Filters**: Narrowing analysis to specific resources
4. **Namespace Filters**: Focusing on events from particular namespaces
5. **Context Information**: Additional data to guide analysis

### Output

The Events Agent produces structured findings with the following information:

```json
{
  "agent_type": "events",
  "finding_id": "event-12345",
  "timestamp": "2023-03-30T15:22:30Z",
  "event_pattern": "Pod restart cascade",
  "evidence": {
    "events": [
      {
        "type": "Warning",
        "reason": "Unhealthy",
        "object": "pod/service-a-1234",
        "message": "Liveness probe failed",

  ],
  "related_findings": ["resource-5678"]
}
```

## Configuration

The Events Agent is configurable through:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - `EVENTS_AGENT_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the agent's logging verbosity
   - `EVENTS_AGENT_MAX_EVENTS`: Maximum number of events to process
   - `EVENTS_AGENT_PATTERN_LIBRARY`: Path to event pattern library

2. **Configuration File** (events_agent_config.yaml):
   ```yaml
   collection:
     real_time: true
     historical_window: "24h"
     batch_size: 500
     include_types: ["Normal", "Warning"]

   filters:
     namespaces: ["default", "kube-system"]
     exclude_sources: ["Horizontal Pod Autoscaler"]
     min_severity: "Warning"

   analysis:
     pattern_detection: true
     sequence_analysis: true
     frequency_analysis: true
     confidence_threshold: 70.0

   performance:
     parallel_processing: true
     max_processing_time: 120
     cache_events: true
   ```

## Integration with Other Components

The Events Agent integrates with:

1. **Orchestrator**: Receives analysis requests and submits findings
2. **Knowledge Base**: Retrieves known event patterns and contributes new patterns
3. **Analysis Engine**: Provides event-based findings for correlation
4. **Logs Agent**: Coordinates timestamp-based correlation with log entries
5. **Resource Agent**: Aligns event findings with resource state information

## Usage Example

```python
from agents.events_agent import EventsAgent

# Initialize the agent
events_agent = EventsAgent(config_path="config/events_agent_config.yaml")

# Perform analysis
findings = events_agent.analyze(
    time_range={"start": "2023-03-30T14:00:00Z", "end": "2023-03-30T16:00:00Z"},
    namespaces=["default"],
    resource_types=["Pod", "Deployment"],
    context={"incident_id": "INC-12345"}
)

# Process findings
for finding in findings:
    print(f"Found issue: {finding['event_pattern']} with confidence {finding['confidence_score']}")
    print(f"Affected components: {', '.join(finding['affected_components'])}")
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Event Volume Management**: Implements sampling and batching for high-volume event streams
- **Caching**: Maintains cache of recent events to reduce API load
- **Selective Processing**: Focuses analysis on events most likely to indicate issues
- **Efficient Filtering**: Uses server-side filtering when possible to reduce data transfer
- **Parallel Analysis**: Processes multiple event patterns concurrently
- **Resource Efficiency**: Monitors and limits resource consumption during analysis

## Error Handling

The Events Agent implements robust error handling for:

1. **API Failures**: Gracefully handles Kubernetes API connectivity issues
2. **Processing Errors**: Manages exceptions during event parsing and analysis
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respects API rate limits with backoff strategies
4. **Timeout Management**: Provides partial results when analysis cannot complete in time
5. **Data Validity**: Validates event data and handles malformed events

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Events Agent include:

1. **Machine Learning Models**: Using ML to identify anomalous event patterns
2. **Cross-Cluster Correlation**: Analyzing events across multiple clusters
3. **Predictive Analysis**: Identifying precursor event patterns to serious issues
4. **Custom Event Definitions**: Supporting user-defined event types and sources
5. **Event Visualization**: Generating graphical representations of event sequences
