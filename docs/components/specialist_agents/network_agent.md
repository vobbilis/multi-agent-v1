# Network Agent

The Network Agent is responsible for analyzing network-related issues and monitoring network performance in the Kubernetes environment.

## Purpose

The Network Agent focuses on identifying and analyzing network-related problems, including connectivity issues, performance bottlenecks, and configuration problems.

## Responsibilities

### Network Monitoring
- Monitors network connectivity
- Tracks network performance
- Analyzes network traffic
- Identifies network issues

### Configuration Analysis
- Analyzes network policies
- Validates network configurations
- Monitors service endpoints
- Tracks DNS resolution

### Performance Analysis
- Analyzes network latency
- Monitors bandwidth usage
- Tracks packet loss
- Identifies bottlenecks

### Security Monitoring
- Monitors network security
- Tracks unauthorized access
- Analyzes network policies
- Identifies security issues
