# Analysis Engine

## Overview

The Analysis Engine is a core component of the Multi-Agent Root Cause Analysis System that correlates, processes, and synthesizes findings from specialist agents to identify the underlying causes of issues in Kubernetes environments. It applies advanced reasoning techniques to connect disparate observations and generate comprehensive analysis reports with actionable insights.

## Responsibilities

- Collecting and integrating findings from multiple specialist agents
- Correlating findings across different domains and time periods
- Identifying causal relationships between observed symptoms
- Applying domain knowledge to interpret patterns
- Generating root cause hypotheses with confidence scores
- Recommending remediation actions
- Producing comprehensive analysis reports

## Implementation Details

The Analysis Engine is implemented as a Python module with the following key components:

1. **Finding Collector**: Receives and manages findings from specialist agents:
   - Aggregates findings from multiple sources
   - Normalizes finding formats for consistent processing
   - Filters and prioritizes significant findings
   - Groups related findings by affected components

2. **Correlation Engine**: Identifies relationships between findings:
   - Temporal correlation (events occurring in sequence)
   - Spatial correlation (events affecting related components)
   - Causal correlation (events with cause-effect relationships)
   - Pattern correlation (events matching known issue patterns)
   - Statistical correlation (unusual co-occurrences)

3. **Reasoning Engine**: Applies analytical techniques to determine root causes:
   - Bayesian inference for probabilistic reasoning
   - Decision trees for structured problem solving
   - Pattern matching against known failure modes
   - Constraint satisfaction for validating hypotheses
   - LLM-based reasoning for complex scenarios

4. **Knowledge Base Interface**: Connects to the knowledge repository:
   - Retrieves relevant failure patterns
   - Accesses historical incident data
   - Obtains component relationship information
   - Updates knowledge base with new findings
   - Learns from successful resolutions

5. **Remediation Recommender**: Suggests solutions based on identified causes:
   - Maps root causes to appropriate remediation actions
   - Prioritizes recommendations by effectiveness and impact
   - Provides step-by-step resolution procedures
   - Suggests preventative measures for future issues
   - Estimates resolution time and resource requirements

6. **Report Generator**: Creates comprehensive analysis reports:
   - Summarizes key findings and evidence
   - Details suspected root causes with confidence levels
   - Visualizes relationships between components and issues
   - Provides recommended remediation steps
   - Includes supporting data and references

## Integration with Other Components

The Analysis Engine integrates with:

1. **Orchestrator**: Receives analysis requests and returns results
2. **Specialist Agents**: Collects findings from all active agents
3. **Knowledge Base**: Retrieves and updates information
4. **Simulation Engine**: Validates hypotheses in simulated environments
5. **Visualization System**: Provides data for interactive displays

## Usage Example

```python
from analysis.engine import AnalysisEngine

# Initialize the engine
analysis_engine = AnalysisEngine(config_path="config/analysis_engine_config.yaml")

# Collect findings from agents
agent_findings = {
    "logs_agent": logs_agent.get_findings(),
    "events_agent": events_agent.get_findings(),
    "resource_agent": resource_agent.get_findings()
}

# Context information
context = {
    "incident_id": "INC-12345",
    "reported_symptoms": "Service unavailable with 500 errors",
    "affected_components": ["service-a", "database-b"]
}

# Perform analysis
analysis_result = analysis_engine.analyze(
    agent_findings=agent_findings,
    context=context,
    component_relationships=knowledge_base.get_component_relationships()
)

# Output the result
print(f"Root Cause: {analysis_result['root_cause_analysis']['primary_cause']['description']}")
print(f"Confidence: {analysis_result['root_cause_analysis']['primary_cause']['confidence']}%")
print("Recommended Actions:")
for rec in analysis_result['remediation_recommendations']:
    print(f"- {rec['action']} (Priority: {rec['priority']})")
```

## Reasoning Algorithms

The Analysis Engine employs several reasoning algorithms:

1. **Bayesian Networks**: Probabilistic model for causal reasoning
   - Represents variables and conditional dependencies
   - Updates beliefs based on observed evidence
   - Handles uncertainty in diagnosis

2. **Temporal Logic**: Reasoning about event sequences
   - Identifies significant ordering of events
   - Detects time-based patterns and anomalies
   - Maps cascading failures across time

3. **Graph Analysis**: Reasoning about component relationships
   - Identifies critical paths and dependencies
   - Detects failure propagation patterns
   - Maps impact spread across the system

4. **LLM-Based Reasoning**: Natural language analysis for complex scenarios
   - Applies domain knowledge to interpret findings
   - Generates natural language explanations
   - Handles complex, multi-factor scenarios

## Performance Considerations

- **Incremental Processing**: Updates analysis as new findings arrive
- **Parallel Analysis**: Processes multiple hypotheses concurrently
- **Prioritized Reasoning**: Focuses on most likely causes first
- **Caching**: Reuses intermediate results when possible
- **Timeouts**: Provides best available analysis within time constraints
- **Resource Management**: Adapts processing depth to available resources

## Error Handling

The Analysis Engine implements robust error handling for:

1. **Incomplete Data**: Generates partial analysis with uncertainty indicators
2. **Contradictory Findings**: Identifies and resolves conflicting evidence
3. **Processing Failures**: Degrades gracefully if specific algorithms fail
4. **Timeout Management**: Returns best available results before deadline
5. **Resource Limitations**: Adapts processing depth to available resources

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Analysis Engine include:

1. **Advanced ML Models**: Incorporating deep learning for pattern recognition
2. **Interactive Analysis**: Supporting human-in-the-loop refinement
3. **Explainable AI**: Improving transparency of reasoning process
4. **Continuous Learning**: Adapting to new failure patterns automatically
5. **Multi-Cluster Analysis**: Supporting root cause analysis across clusters
