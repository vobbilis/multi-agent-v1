# System Components

This directory contains documentation for each component of the Multi-Agent Root Cause Analysis System. The system follows a modular architecture with specialized components that work together to analyze and diagnose problems in Kubernetes environments.

## Component Overview

The system consists of the following core components:

### Analysis Engine
- [Analysis Engine Documentation](analysis_engine.md)
- **Purpose**: Core analytical component that determines root causes
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Integrates findings from specialist agents
  - Identifies causal relationships between events
  - Applies LLM-based reasoning to determine root causes
  - Generates confidence scores for different hypotheses
  - Produces actionable recommendations

### Simulation Engine
- [Simulation Engine Documentation](simulation_engine.md)
- **Purpose**: Simulates and validates failure scenarios
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Creates controlled failure environments
  - Validates root cause analysis accuracy
  - Tests system resilience
  - Provides training data for the analysis engine
  - Supports scenario-based testing

### Specialist Agents
The system includes specialized agents for different aspects of analysis:

#### Events Agent
- [Events Agent Documentation](specialist_agents/events_agent.md)
- **Purpose**: Processes and analyzes Kubernetes events
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Monitors cluster events
  - Identifies event patterns
  - Correlates events with incidents
  - Provides event-based insights

#### Logs Agent
- [Logs Agent Documentation](specialist_agents/logs_agent.md)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes log data for patterns and anomalies
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Collects and processes logs
  - Identifies log patterns
  - Correlates logs with events
  - Provides log-based insights

## Component Communication

Components communicate through a combination of:

1. **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication for event distribution
2. **REST APIs**: Synchronous interactions between components
3. **Shared Storage**: For larger data sets and persistent information
4. **Direct gRPC calls**: For high-performance, low-latency communication

## Data Flow Between Components

1. **Incident Detection**:
   - External systems or monitoring alerts trigger an incident
   - Analysis Engine creates an investigation context
   - Relevant specialist agents are activated

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Specialist agents gather data from their respective domains
   - Data is normalized and preprocessed
   - Initial patterns and anomalies are identified

3. **Finding Generation**:
   - Specialist agents perform domain-specific analysis
   - Findings are reported to the Analysis Engine
   - Analysis Engine may request additional data as needed

4. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Analysis Engine receives integrated findings
   - Causal relationships are identified
   - Root cause hypotheses are generated and tested

5. **Results and Recommendations**:
   - Most likely root causes are determined
   - Recommendations for resolution are generated
   - Results are stored for future reference
   - Notifications are sent through the API Gateway

## Component Interfaces

Each component exposes well-defined interfaces:

### Analysis Engine Interfaces
- **Findings Ingestion API**: Consume agent findings
- **Analysis API**: Trigger and manage analyses
- **Results API**: Report analysis results
- **Knowledge Query API**: Access historical data

### Simulation Engine Interfaces
- **Scenario API**: Create and manage test scenarios
- **Validation API**: Validate analysis results
- **Environment API**: Control test environments
- **Results API**: Report simulation outcomes

### Specialist Agent Interfaces
- **Task API**: Receive and process analysis tasks
- **Findings API**: Report analysis findings
- **Data Source API**: Connect to external data sources
- **Health API**: Report agent health and status

## Component Configuration

Each component is configurable through:

1. **Configuration Files**: YAML files for static configuration
2. **Environment Variables**: For sensitive information and deployment-specific settings
3. **Dynamic Configuration API**: For runtime configuration changes
4. **Feature Flags**: For enabling/disabling specific functionality

## Component Development

Guidelines for developing or extending components:

1. **Modularity**: Components should have clear boundaries and responsibilities
2. **Testability**: Components should be easily testable in isolation
3. **Resiliency**: Components should handle failures gracefully
4. **Observability**: Components should expose metrics, logs, and traces
5. **Security**: Components should follow security best practices
6. **Performance**: Components should be optimized for their specific role

## Component Deployment

Components can be deployed:

1. **As Kubernetes Resources**: Deployments, StatefulSets, Jobs
2. **As Standalone Services**: For external deployment
3. **As Library Components**: For embedded use in other services
