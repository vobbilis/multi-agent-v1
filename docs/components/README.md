# System Components

This directory contains documentation for each component of the Multi-Agent Root Cause Analysis System. The system follows a modular architecture with specialized components that work together to analyze and diagnose problems in Kubernetes environments.

## Component Overview

![Component Architecture](../diagrams/component_architecture.png)

## Core Components

### Orchestrator
- [Orchestrator Documentation](orchestrator.md)
- **Purpose**: Central coordination component that manages the analysis workflow
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages incident lifecycle
  - Directs specialist agents based on context
  - Aggregates findings from multiple sources
  - Coordinates the overall analysis workflow
  - Manages state of ongoing investigations

### Specialist Agents
- [Specialist Agents Overview](specialist_agents.md)
- **Purpose**: Domain-specific components that analyze different aspects of the system
- **Types**:
  - [Logs Agent](logs_agent.md): Analyzes log data for patterns and anomalies
  - [Events Agent](events_agent.md): Processes Kubernetes events
  - [Resources Agent](resources_agent.md): Monitors resource utilization metrics
  - [Network Agent](network_agent.md): Analyzes network traffic and connectivity
  - [Storage Agent](storage_agent.md): Examines storage-related issues
  - [Configuration Agent](configuration_agent.md): Reviews configuration issues

### Analysis Engine
- [Analysis Engine Documentation](analysis_engine.md)
- **Purpose**: Core analytical component that determines root causes
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Integrates findings from specialist agents
  - Identifies causal relationships between events
  - Applies LLM-based reasoning to determine root causes
  - Generates confidence scores for different hypotheses
  - Produces actionable recommendations

### Knowledge Base
- [Knowledge Base Documentation](knowledge_base.md)
- **Purpose**: System memory and reference store
- **Content**:
  - Historical incidents and resolutions
  - Common failure patterns and signatures
  - Component relationships and dependencies
  - Best practices and resolution strategies
  - Learning from past analyses

### API Gateway
- [API Gateway Documentation](api_gateway.md)
- **Purpose**: Unified interface for external integrations
- **Features**:
  - RESTful API for system interaction
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting and request validation
  - Webhook integration for external systems
  - Query capabilities for historical incidents

### Visualization Layer
- [Visualization Layer Documentation](visualization.md)
- **Purpose**: Presentation of analysis results and insights
- **Features**:
  - Interactive incident timelines
  - Causal relationship graphs
  - Resource utilization dashboards
  - Recommendation displays
  - Historical trend analysis

## Component Communication

Components communicate through a combination of:

1. **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication for event distribution
2. **REST APIs**: Synchronous interactions between components
3. **Shared Storage**: For larger data sets and persistent information
4. **Direct gRPC calls**: For high-performance, low-latency communication

## Data Flow Between Components

1. **Incident Detection**:
   - External systems or monitoring alerts trigger an incident
   - Orchestrator creates an investigation context
   - Relevant specialist agents are activated

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Specialist agents gather data from their respective domains
   - Data is normalized and preprocessed
   - Initial patterns and anomalies are identified

3. **Finding Generation**:
   - Specialist agents perform domain-specific analysis
   - Findings are reported to the Orchestrator
   - Orchestrator may request additional data as needed

4. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Analysis Engine receives integrated findings
   - Causal relationships are identified
   - Root cause hypotheses are generated and tested

5. **Results and Recommendations**:
   - Most likely root causes are determined
   - Recommendations for resolution are generated
   - Results are stored in the Knowledge Base
   - Notifications are sent through the API Gateway

## Component Interfaces

Each component exposes well-defined interfaces:

### Orchestrator Interfaces
- **Agent Management API**: Control and monitor specialist agents
- **Incident API**: Manage incidents and investigations
- **Task Queue**: Distribute tasks to specialist agents
- **Status API**: Report system status and component health

### Specialist Agent Interfaces
- **Task API**: Receive and process analysis tasks
- **Findings API**: Report analysis findings
- **Data Source API**: Connect to external data sources
- **Health API**: Report agent health and status

### Analysis Engine Interfaces
- **Findings Ingestion API**: Consume agent findings
- **Analysis API**: Trigger and manage analyses
- **Results API**: Report analysis results
- **Knowledge Query API**: Access the Knowledge Base

### Knowledge Base Interfaces
- **Query API**: Search and retrieve knowledge
- **Storage API**: Store new knowledge
- **Learning API**: Update patterns and relationships
- **Export API**: Export knowledge for backup or transfer

### API Gateway Interfaces
- **External REST API**: For client applications
- **Webhook API**: For event notifications
- **Authentication API**: For access control
- **Internal API**: For component communication

## Component Configuration

Each component is configurable through:

1. **Configuration Files**: YAML files for static configuration
2. **Environment Variables**: For sensitive information and deployment-specific settings
3. **Dynamic Configuration API**: For runtime configuration changes
4. **Feature Flags**: For enabling/disabling specific functionality

## Component Development

Guidelines for developing or extending components:

1. **Modularity**: Components should have clear boundaries and responsibilities
2. **Testability**: Components should be easily testable in isolation
3. **Resiliency**: Components should handle failures gracefully
4. **Observability**: Components should expose metrics, logs, and traces
5. **Security**: Components should follow security best practices
6. **Performance**: Components should be optimized for their specific role

## Component Deployment

Components can be deployed:

1. **As Kubernetes Resources**: Deployments, StatefulSets, Jobs
2. **As Standalone Services**: For external deployment
3. **As Library Components**: For embedded use in other services
