## Communication

Components communicate through:
- Message Queue
- REST APIs
- Shared Storage
- gRPC calls

## Data Flow

1. Incident Detection
   - Events Agent detects incidents
   - Logs Agent analyzes logs
   - Metrics Agent monitors metrics

2. Data Collection
   - Specialist agents gather data
   - Data is processed and normalized
   - Information is stored

3. Finding Generation
   - Agents analyze their data
   - Findings are generated
   - Results are aggregated

4. Root Cause Analysis
   - Analysis Engine processes findings
   - Patterns are identified
   - Root causes are determined

5. Results and Recommendations
   - Analysis results are generated
   - Resolution recommendations are provided
   - Results are stored

## Interfaces

### Analysis Engine API
